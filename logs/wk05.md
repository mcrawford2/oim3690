# Review
- how to add css to a page: external, internal, inline
- inline overrides external or internal because it comes later in the code (cascade)
- cascade: when there are conflucting styles on one piece of code, the latest one overrides previoud styles

# What I learned
- selectors
    - element: p{}
    - class: .inrto{}
    - ID: #header{}
    - universal: *{}
- combining selectors
    - /* element with class */
        p.intro{}
    - */ element with ID */
        ...
- selector specificity
    - element selectors
    - class selectors
    - id selectors
    - inline styles

    - named colors: red, blue
    - hex colors: color: #ff0000
    - rgb/rgba: rgb(00, 00, 00)
- typography
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - font-weight
    - font-style
    - text align
    - text decoration

# Extra files
- s09_demo.html 

# Questions
- do i need to create new demo files for every new session, or keep one file and reuse for each class?

# Mini Project 1
- I have not gotten very far with the project, but have a very basic website structure that I started. 
- AI usage: after I created my basic structure, I asked AI to "enhance, very simply"
- I asked AI to help make three pages for the website rather than my one, because I was unsure if those would be under the same file or new files.
