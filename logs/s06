# Review
- three languages of the web: HTML, CSS, Javascript
    - HTML: defines content and structure. HyperTextMarkupLanguage
    - CSS: visual presentation, colors fonts and styling
    - Javascript: interactivity, animations and buttons
- how to investigate what is wrong on a website: inspect, depends on specific issue
- how to use DevTools to change the headline of any website: inspect, locate headline, edit, apply/enter, only you will see the changes

# What I learned
- alt + shift + f: format code
- indentation matters to readers of the code, not for visual browser purposes
- HTML is not a programming language, has a one to one matching relationship so no variables or logic
- <> is a tag
- HTML features
    - <h1></h1>: headings, levels 1-6
    - <p></p>: paragraphs
    - <a></a>: links
    - <img></img>: images
    - <div></div>: generic container
- attribute: extra information inside the opening tag. ex/ <a href=https://...>... </a>
- <li> defines a list item
