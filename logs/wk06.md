# Review
- inspect -> devtools to find fonts and colors on a website you like

# What I learned
- quick selectors: element, class, ID, descendant, grouping
- <div> block container. 
- <span> inline container (highlight one word in a sentence)
- display types: block and inline
- block: stack vertically, takes full width of entire row
- inline: in notes
- pseudo classes: "a keyword that is added to a selector to define a special state of an element," based on user interaction
- smooth changes: add .transition between style changes 

# To do
- create interests.html
