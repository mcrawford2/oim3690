# What I learned
- DNS: domain name system/service, looks like a table that converts IP addresses
- 404: error/can't find, 200: works
- when viewing a webpage, the computer downloads all files that are allowed of it that aren't already stored
- GET vs POST: get retrieves data without changing server, asks browser for information. post sends data to the back end and hope back up uses it to create/update
- windows key + period key = emojis

# Activity: Peer Questions
1. the meaning of the first couple lines of all out codes (4+5) after <head>, including "UTF-8" and "viewpoint"
2. how is the structure of the HTML code is controlled, general syntax and organization
3. the meaning of <div or <div class
4. why some websites might have <span and others dont
5. how is the code organized by color, (body, root, and container have yellow text while font, color, and margin have blue text)

# Updates to Website
- need to redefine what website is for
- was going to be trip planning application, but this might work better for OIM3640 class
- this site might be more useful as a site built for APA(Animal People Alliance, non-profit) or something else
