# New Prompt, using replit 
Using the description below, generate a simple HTML file called index.html only. 

Description: 
I am Miranda Crawford, a Babson College student. 
I am making a website to be used as one part of a broader website making portfolio. 
This website is for trip planning. It can include both a suggested trips section based 
on different types of trips, as well as the main section that would be for self inputting 
and creating the details of self planned trip. Inputs include budget, itinerary, locations, 
activities, outfits, food, energy level.  These can be per the entire trip and per day. 
There can also be a map integration with flagged places/activities/restaurants. With a user 
account, users can save trips and come back to them later.  

Requirements: 
- One single HTML file (index.html) 
- No external frameworks 
- Clean and simple layout 
- Include: 
  - Header with my name 
  - Short introduction 
  - A section for skills or interests 



  # 10 things I do not yet understand (from index.html)
1. the meaning of <meta in lines 4 and 5
2. the meaning of "UTF-8" and "viewport" from lines 4 and 5
3. in lines 86-89, why it goes in order of style, head, body, header, with lines 
    underneath but no clear way to track what is being said about each
4. the meaning od <div in line 109
5. does layout/style have to be written before content?
6. the meaning of </strong> in lines 111 through 115
7. the meaning of </p>, and if that is different from <p>
8. does it use standard hex codes for colors? 
9. why is it often that when words are in parenthesis, "--" is placed before the 
    word? (ex/ (--primary) on line 36)
10. specific formatting/style rules for the categories background, padding, border 
    radius, text-align, font weight, margin-top, border-left, grid-template-columns, 
    display, gap, etc.
